## Introduction

Our world moves faster than ever due to an unprecedented rate of technological innovation, especially in software.  

Software demand, touch-points and competition are growing simultaneously.  If you're an organization or an entrepreneur looking to succeed, you must move faster, innovate more, at scale, with greater efficiency than ever.  At the same time, strategies that contribute overhead and complexity will cost you greatly.

### The Cloud

The cloud is a solution to these challenges.  Cloud vendors maintain physical datacenter infrastructure so you don't have to and enable you to use it via virtual interfaces.  This solution has become so effective that organizations and entrepreneurs around the world are rapidly adopting platforms by cloud vendors, like *Amazon Web Services*, *Microsoft Azure* & *Google Cloud Platform*.

There is only one problem, cloud vendors' virtual services still greatly resemble the physical infrastructure they are built upon, in how they are provisioned, operated and scaled.  As a result, organizational cultures, structures and processes for delivering software have not fundamentally changed, which greatly distracts them from achieving their business goals.

While the burden of physical infrastructure maintenance has been lifted, the cloud must evolve to look less like the infrastructure that powers it and more like the solutions we need to solve business problems.

### The Serverless Movement

The experience of how we deliver software to achieve business solutions via cloud platforms must change.
