*Authored by the community, curated by [Serverless, Inc.](https://serverless.com/)*

## Vision

This is your definitive guide to serverless architectures. Inside, you will find everything you need to know about serverless development and how to be a serverless organization: patterns, best practices, case studies and everything in-between.

Aside from implementation, this guide is a collection and discussion of concerns around the state and maturity of serverless. A lot is being written about serverless technology all over the web, and right now that information is fragmented. As a community, weâ€™re bringing it together.

The goal is to create a one-of-a-kind, trusted resource for developers, architects and thought leaders. This should be a valuable resource that will help drive adoption and innovation of serverless architectures.

Are you with us? We want [you to be part](./README.md#how-to-contribute) of this journey.
